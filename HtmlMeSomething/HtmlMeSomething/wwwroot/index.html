            <h3>Harmful Toxins</h3>
            <p>
                Most dog owners know that chocolate can be deadly to dogs. But did you know how many others
                foods there are that dogs should never eat? Even more dangerous than chocolate are onions, garlic,
                avacado, grapes, and raisins.<br /><br />Will you have most likely heard of giving a dog a bone, you
                should never actually do this. Animal bones can splinter and either block or cut your dog's
                digestive system.<br /><br />The most deadly of all? Xylitol. This is often found in gum, candy,
                diet sweetners, and toothpaste. Make sure to keep these common products, along with the foods
                listed above, out of reach of your dog at all times.

            <h3>Weather Hazards</h3>
            <p>
                Hot weather doesn't just affect you. Some summertime hazards you should be careful of are
                heat stroke and sunburn. If the concrete is too hot for your bare feet, it is too hot for your
                dogs paws!<br /><br />Cold weather can be just as dangerous. Be careful to keep your dogs paws safe
                from the ice and snow which can cause frostbite. Most sidewalk salt is also harmful to dogs paws
                which can absorb the harmful toxins. Most stores sell dog safe sidewalk salt, but beware that most
                homes and stores will not when you are taking your dog on walks.

            <h3>Safe Driving</h3>
            <p>
                Car rides are necessary for all pet owners, whether going to the vet or around town, so making
                sure our dogs are safe in the car is important. If we are expected to wear seat belts, why wouldn't
                our dogs? There are very inexpensive harnesses for dogs that hook into the seat belt hook in cars.
                <br /><br />Just like you should never leave a child in a car alone, you should also never leave
                your dog. Even on a 78&#8457 day, the temperature in a parked car can get up to 100&#8457 to 120&#8457
                in minutes. Imagine how hot it would get if it were a 90&#8457 day!
